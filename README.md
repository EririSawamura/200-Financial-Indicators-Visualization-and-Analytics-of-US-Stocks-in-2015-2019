# 200-Financial-Indicators-Visualization-and-Analytics-of-US-Stocks-in-2015-2019
A MSBD5014 Independent Project in HKUST

This project makes an indicator analysis and indicator learning on financial indicators in US stocks. During the data preprocessing part, extreme value, missing value, wrong value, and imbalanced data are handled carefully. In the indicator learning part, I use the XGBoost model to train these indicators, so as to predict the price variation. In some sectors, its testing MSE can be lower than 300 and has a nearly 90\% classification accuracy. During the indicator learning, I also find that the feature importance to each sector and each year is quite different, and feature popularity does not imply the feature importance. In the indication correlation part, I find the correlation between price variation and indicators (positive, negative, no influence) in each year and each sector, which can help make conclusions that which indicator usually has what influence on which sector. Also, whether the indicatorâ€™s correlation has significant influence does not imply whether it is important for making contributions to the price variation prediction.
